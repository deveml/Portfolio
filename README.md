# ⚡️ Vite - React - Mui - Typescript boilerplate ⚡️

This repository acts as a jump-start/template/boiler-plate for people who want to get started on a project without setting up linter, theme engine & what not.

## Dependencies used in the project

1. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Super fast bundler (Better than Webpack). HMR is the best feature that you get out of the box
2. [MUI](https://mui.com/) - Arguably, I yet again specify, arguably the best UI library available right now.
3. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - One of the best UI prototyping toolkit available. (Trust me, you'll thank me later for using Storybook)
4. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter which is tweaked to support Typescript, React Vite & React storybook.
5. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A library dedicated to testing react components & javascript code.

> 💡 Whatever config that I've added can be overwritten and adjusted to your liking & use-case.
